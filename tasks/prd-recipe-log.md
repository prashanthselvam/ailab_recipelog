# Product Requirements Document: Recipe Log

## Introduction/Overview

Recipe Log is a web application designed to help users organize, search, and manage their personal recipe collections.
The primary user is someone who currently uses Instagram as a private recipe journal but needs better search and
organization capabilities. The app will sync with Instagram to import existing recipe posts and allow users to enhance
them with additional metadata like tags, detailed recipes, and structured information while maintaining the visual,
feed-like browsing experience they're accustomed to.

**Problem Statement:** Instagram provides an excellent visual catalog for recipe photos but lacks robust search
functionality and structured recipe organization, making it difficult to find specific recipes when needed.

**Goal:** Create a searchable, organized recipe management system that integrates seamlessly with existing Instagram
workflows while providing enhanced functionality for recipe discovery and management.

## Goals

1. **Primary Goal:** Enable users to easily search and find recipes from their personal collection using text-based
   search
2. **Secondary Goal:** Provide seamless Instagram integration for importing existing recipe posts
3. **Tertiary Goal:** Allow users to enhance imported recipes with structured data (tags, ingredients, instructions)
4. **Long-term Goal:** Create a comprehensive recipe management system that could eventually replace Instagram for
   recipe logging

## User Stories

1. **As a recipe enthusiast**, I want to sync my Instagram posts so that I can import my existing recipe collection
   without manual data entry.

2. **As a home cook**, I want to search for recipes by typing keywords so that I can quickly find that pasta dish I made
   last month.

3. **As a recipe organizer**, I want to add tags to my recipes so that I can categorize them by cuisine type, meal
   category, or dietary restrictions.

4. **As a visual learner**, I want to view my recipes in a feed-like interface so that I can browse through them similar
   to Instagram.

5. **As a detailed cook**, I want to add structured recipe information (ingredients, instructions, cooking time) so that
   I can have complete recipe details in one place.

6. **As a busy person**, I want the sync process to be simple and intuitive so that I can keep my recipe collection
   up-to-date without hassle.
