- Used https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks to get going. Followed it more or less to the tee
- Got through the entire first phase of the tasks. It really can just run on its own.
- The UI it came up with for the auth forms is pretty trash. I feel like auth and the base styling is just such a
  critical part of the app. It might make more sense to actually build out this initial skeleton on your own and then
  let AI do more of the filling in.
- This could be something to experiment with tomorrow. Imagine having a really solid base template from which you can
  get started. Then you don't need to spend all this time with AI to set up this initial scaffolding.
