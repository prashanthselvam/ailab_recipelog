### Tests

- `recipes/tests/test_models.py` - Recipe model tests

### Notes

- Use `python manage.py test` to run Django tests
- Use `npm test` in the frontend directory to run React tests
- Django media files will be stored locally in `media/` directory during development
- CORS will be configured to allow React development server to communicate with Django
- React development server runs on http://localhost:5173 (Vite default)
- Django development server runs on http://localhost:8000
